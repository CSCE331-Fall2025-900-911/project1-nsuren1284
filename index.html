      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a junior computer science student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>.</p>
      <p>I am from San Antonio, Texas, but originally Chicago!</p>
      <p>My first coding experience was with <a href="https://girlswhocode.com" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>, which sparked my love for programming.</p>

      <h2>My life On Campus</h2>
      <p> Here on campus, I am a part of two organizations: Aggie Women in Computer Science and the Society of Women Engineers. I've been involved in these since my freshman year and continue to do so. I've served on committees for the Society of Women Engineers for our high school conferences as well as STEMfest, an annual event where Girl Scouts from all over Texas come to campus to learn more about STEM fields and careers. It truly was a rewarding experience getting to help with the creative process from start to finish for these committees and seeing our efforts rewarded by the fun and enthusiasm the girls have when they come to our events.
        When I joined Aggie Women in Computer Science, I also joined as a mentee in their mentorship program known as RUBIES. During my freshman and sophomore years, I had the same mentor, and it was a really nice experience getting to connect with someone older than me, confide in them, ask questions about course selection and college life in general, and develop a meaningful connection with someone who shares the same aspirations as me. I also thoroughly enjoyed connecting with other mentees who were either in my grade or a year above and gaining those connections as well. Now, as a junior, I am looking forward to signing up to be a mentor for the same program that did wonders for me. I am truly ecstatic for what this year holds, and Iâ€™m very eager to meet my mentee and be able to provide them with the same support that I was given from my older peers in AWiCS.</p>
