  <h1>My Qualifications:</h1>
  <p> I am student at Texas A&M University pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. Over the years I have developed a passion for business, activism, and tech, and I am hoping to incorporate these interests of mine into future endeavors.
    In my current role as a Social Media and Marketing
    Intern at Anchored To You LLC, I have gained hands-on experience in social media strategy, identifying popular
    beauty trends to develop marketing collateral that speaks to a diverse audience. I helped conduct market research for
    the brand and assisted on long-term planning and price-related projects. Additionally, I was
    a summer web development intern in 2024 for Back to Basics Learning, where I enhanced the digital presence of
    their 15-page website. I identified and implemented crucial website updates, including SEO optimization, formatting
    revisions, and performance improvements, which led to a 20% increase in site traffic in two months. I also aided in
    the development of three related company websites offering different services by prioritizing seamless user
    experiences and consistent branding across these platforms. This experience was incredibly rewarding and
    insightful. Not only was I able to expand my creative and technical skill sets in web development, but I also learned
    how to utilize strategic digital enhancements to optimize workflows and drive engagement and growth, which are
    skills that I am eager to bring to my future roles.
